# Collaborative_Intelligence_Project at DFKI: Mapping Infrastructure and Monitor Urbanization in Europe

# Description:
An automated mapping and monitoring of urban enviornments through an AI-based analysis using orbital or airborne remote sensed data is of crucial importance to urban areas. In this project, I have used satellite or aerial imagery and state-of-the-art deep learning methods to map urban areas, in particular infrastructure(eg. residential houses, streets, industry).

# Installation:
1) Clone this repository into your Local Machine
2) Install the necessary libraries like Gdal, Keras, Image processing libraries(openCV) etc. Do this by making a new Enviornment in Conda.
Note about Gdal: The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library is a computer software library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats, and is released under the permissive X/MIT style free software license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation.
Install Gdal using: conda install gdal
